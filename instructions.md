# Dynamic Endocast By Bone -- Details and Instructions

This document describes the workflow and functions in detail, and provides instructions for its use.

## dynamicEndocastByBone logic and explanation

In essense, `dynamicEndocastByBone` asks: what happens to oral cavity volume when you 'freeze' a specific bone for a short period of time? The difference between the un-frozen volume change and the frozen volume change is, by definition, capturing the impact of the frozen bone's motion on oral volume change. 

## dynamicEndocastByBone function details

`dynamicEndocastByBone` supports both GUI and command line initialization. For GUI-based interaction, simply run this in the MATLAB console:
```matlab
dynamicEndocastByBone
```
If you wish to explicitly declare the function inputs (useful for automation), you can run this:
```matlab
dynamicEndocastByBone(datapath,XYZfile,RBTfile,refbone,freezeIncrement,savepath,savefile,objFolder)
```

In either case, the function requires the following inputs: 
1. `datapath` - full path of your data files
2. `XYZfile` - csv file containing XYZ locator positions through time (generated by Maya function)
3. `RBTfile` - 
4. `refbone`
5. `freezeIncrement`
6. `savepath`
7. `savefile`
8. `objFolder`
