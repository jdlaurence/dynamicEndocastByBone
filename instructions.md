# dynamicEndocastByBone -- Details and Instructions

This document describes the workflow and functions in detail, and provides instructions for its use.

## Before running the script
You need:   
* The scripts from this package copied into your MATLAB path.
* Autodesk Maya and the MayaTools shelf installed
* Bone mesh models and corresponding rigid body transformations from XMALab  
* Optional: 3D points from XMALab
### Determine optimal freeze increment
Freeze increments should be selected based upon frequency of behavior (we recommend roughly 10% of behavior duration). Researchers should additionally examine the "delta volume" curves at various freeze increments to check for oversmoothing.
## Inputs and call syntax

`dynamicEndocastByBone` supports both GUI and command line initialization. For GUI-based interaction, simply run this in the MATLAB console:
```matlab
dynamicEndocastByBone
```
If you wish to explicitly declare the function inputs (useful for automation), you can run this:
```matlab
dynamicEndocastByBone(datapath,XYZfile,RBTfile,refbone,freezeIncrement,savepath,savefile,objFolder)
```

In either case, the function requires the following inputs: 
1. `datapath` - *string* - full path of your data files
2. `XYZfile` - *string* - full path of the CSV file containing XYZ locator positions through time (generated by Maya function)
3. `RBTfile` - *string* - full path of the CSV file containing the rigid body transformation of the reference bone (**typically the neurocranium**)
4. `refbone` - *string* - **exact** name of reference bone as used in column headers in XYZFile (e.g. ...)
5. `freezeIncrement` - *double* - 
6. `savepath` - *string* - 
7. `savefile` - *string* - 
8. `objFolder` - *string* - 

## Calculate RCVC

## Visual checks in Maya
Use 'exportAlphaShapeAsOBJ.m' and 'impHullsNew.mel' to verify that the alpha hulls for each frozen bone are behaving as anticipated.
