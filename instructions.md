# Dynamic Endocast By Bone -- Details and Instructions

This document describes the workflow and functions in detail, and provides instructions for its use.

## dynamicEndocastByBone logic and explanation

In essense, `dynamicEndocastByBone` asks: what happens to oral cavity volume when you 'freeze' a specific bone for a short period of time? The difference between the un-frozen volume change and the frozen volume change is, by definition, capturing the impact of the frozen bone's motion on oral volume change. 

## dynamicEndocastByBone function details

`dynamicEndocastByBone` supports both GUI and command line initialization. For GUI-based interaction, simply run this in the console:
```matlab
dynamicEndocastByBone
```
If you wish to explicitly declare the function inputs (useful for automation), you can run this:
```matlab
dynamicEndocastByBone(datapath,XYZfile,RBTfile,refbone,freezeIncrement,savepath,savefile,objFolder)
```

Input arguments: 
1. `datapath` - full path of your data files
2. `XYZfile` - csv file containing XYZ locator positions through time (generated by Maya function)
3. `RBTfile` - 
4. `refbone`
5. `freezeIncrement`
6. `savepath`
7. `savefile`
8. `objFolder`

1. Install the latest version of XMALab found [here](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/xmalab/).
2. Follow [DLC documentation](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md) to install Anaconda environment. We recommend using the provided [easy install](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md).
3. If you haven't already, clone or download this repository, and locate the XROMM_DLCTools [functions](/functions/xrommtools.py) and [Demo Jupyter Notebook](/templates/XROMM_Pipeline_Demo.ipynb)
4. **Copy** the xrommtools.py file into the DLC Anaconda environment's utils folder, which can be found where Anaconda was installed- here: ...\Anaconda3\envs\dlc-windowsGPU\Lib\site-packages\deeplabcut\utils

      Or on a Mac:

      .../opt/anaconda3/envs/dlc-macOS-CPU/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/utils
