# dynamicEndocastByBone

_**Quantify the contribution of individual bones to oral cavity volume change in [XROMM](https://www.xromm.org/) animations.**_

**Publication:** [Whitlow et al. (2022)](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb) -- See _Volumetric Analysis_ section of paper for detailed explanation. 

**Description:** In short, `dynamicEndocastByBone` is a MATLAB function that performs a rolling freeze (for a user-specified duration) of each individual bone in an XROMM animation relative to a reference bone (e.g., neurocranium). The difference in endocast volume between the frozen and unfrozen animation is the impact of that bone's motion on endocast volume, at that time-point. The impact of freezing a given bone relative to the sum of all bones' impacts is that bone's **relative contribution to volume change (RCVC)**.
